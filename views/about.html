    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Lovelace was the daughter of famed poet Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke
      Byron, who legally separated two months after her birth. Her father then
      left Britain forever, and his daughter never knew him personally. She was
      educated privately by tutors and then self-educated but was helped in her
      advanced studies by mathematician-logician Augustus De Morgan, the first
      professor of mathematics at the University of London. On July 8, 1835, she
      married William King, 8th Baron King, and, when he was created an earl in
      1838, she became countess of Lovelace. <br />

      Lovelace became interested in Babbage’s machines as early as 1833 when she
      was introduced to Babbage by their mutual friend, author Mary Somerville,
      and, most notably, in 1843 came to translate and annotate an article
      written by the Italian mathematician and engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea,
      “Notions sur la machine analytique de Charles Babbage” (1842; “Elements of
      Charles Babbage’s Analytical Machine”). Her detailed and elaborate
      annotations (especially her description of how the proposed Analytical
      Engine could be programmed to compute Bernoulli numbers) were excellent;
      “the Analytical Engine,” she said, “weaves algebraic patterns, just as the
      Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves.” <br />
      
      Babbage only built a small part
      of the Analytical Engine, but Lovelace’s efforts have been remembered. The
      early programming language Ada was named for her, and the second Tuesday
      in October has become Ada Lovelace Day, on which the contributions of
      women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are honoured.
